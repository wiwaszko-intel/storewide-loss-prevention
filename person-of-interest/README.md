# POI Re-identification: Real-Time Retail Loss Prevention

The POI Re-identification system is a real-time retail loss-prevention application that detects enrolled Persons of Interest (POIs) across multiple cameras using OpenVINO™ face re-identification and FAISS vector search. Integrated with Scenescape spatial computing, it delivers instant security alerts and supports offline historical investigation to trace suspect movements across all cameras and time ranges.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone -b release-2026.2.0 --single-branch https://github.com/intel-retail/storewide-loss-prevention.git
cd storewide-loss-prevention/person-of-interest

# Initialize submodules
make update-submodules

# Initialize environment and start (pulls images from Docker Hub automatically)
make init
make up
```
