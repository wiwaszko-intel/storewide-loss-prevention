The Suspicious Activity Detection (SAD) application is a store-wide loss prevention reference
workload that demonstrates how Scenescape, OpenVINO™, and a Vision Language Model
(VLM) can be combined on a single Intel® platform to detect suspicious in-store
behavior in real time.

It combines several services:

- **swlp-service:** MQTT-driven core that subscribes to Scenescape, manages
  per-person session state, evaluates declarative rules, and emits alerts.
- **Behavioral Analysis Service:** Runs pose detection plus a VLM
  (Qwen2.5-VL) to confirm whether a person is concealing merchandise in a
  HIGH_VALUE zone.
- **Alert Service:** Time-window-based deduplication and downstream delivery of
  alerts to MQTT topics, REST consumers, and the dashboard.
- **Frame storage (SeaweedFS / MinIO):** Cropped person frames stored per
  visit; a per-alert evidence prefix is created when an alert fires.
- **Gradio UI:** Dashboard for live alerts, sessions, and evidence frames.

Together, these components illustrate how vision-based AI inference, rule
evaluation, and downstream alerting can be orchestrated, monitored, and
visualized for a retail loss-prevention scenario.
